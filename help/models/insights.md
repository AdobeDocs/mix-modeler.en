# Model insights

Each visualization in model insights is designed to help you to:

* Visualize and quantify the impact of your organization's marketing activities.
* Identify which channels are high-performing.
* Identify which channels might need optimization.

These insights then help you to support resource prioritization and allocation.

To view model insights, in the ![Models](/help/assets/icons/FileData.svg) **[!UICONTROL Models]** interface in Mix Modeler:

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Models]** table, select the name of a model that has a **[!UICONTROL Last run status]** of ![StatusGreen](/help/assets/icons/StatusGreen.svg) **[!UICONTROL Success]**.
   
1. From the context menu, select **[!UICONTROL Model Insights]**.



The following tabs are available:

* [Model insights](#model-insights)
* [Channel synergy](#channel-synergy)
* [Factors](#factors-beta) [!BADGE beta]
* [Attribution](#attribution) (only for MTA enabled models) 
* [Diagnostics](#diagnostics) 
* [Historical overview](#historical-overview).

You can change the date period on which the visualizations on each of the tabs are based on. Enter a date period or select ![Calendar](/help/assets/icons/Calendar.svg) to select a date period.

## Model drift

{{release-limited-testing-section}}

If model drift is detected on the model, you see a **[!UICONTROL Model drift detected]** dialog with options to be reminded later or to immediately [**[!UICONTROL Retrain]**](overview.md#retrain) the model. If you select **[!UICONTROL Remind me later]**, you are reminded the next day or at the next login. 

![Model drift detected dialog](/help/assets/model-drift-dialog.png)

## [!UICONTROL Model insights]

The Model insights tab shows visualizations for [Contribution by date and base media](#contribution-by-date-and-base-media), [Contribution by channel](#contribution-by-channel), [Marketing performance summary](#marketing-performance-summary), and [Marginal response curves](#marginal-response-curves). The tab also provides a [Touchpoint breakdown](#touchppint-breakdown) table.

![Model - Model insights](/help/assets/model-insights-insights.png)

* You can hover over individual chart elements in each visualization to display a popover with more details.

* To download a CSV file containing the data for the visualization, select ![Download](/help/assets/icons/Download.svg).

* To download full model insights data in Microsoft&reg; Excel format, select ![Download](/help/assets/icons/Download.svg) **[!UICONTROL Download data]**. 


### Contribution by date and base media 

This stacked graph visualization is ordered as follows: 

* The base is displayed at the bottom. 
* Non-spend channels are displayed in the middle.
* Spend channels are displayed on top. 

This visualization represents the contribution proportion achieved by base, by spend channels, and by non-spend channels, across a date range. This visualization is helpful to showcase incrementality. The base represents what would have happened without any marketing at all, and the non-spend channels plus spend channels (on top of the base) attribute to your marketing's impact. In short, non-spend plus spend equals the incremental impact of your marketing efforts and the visualization provides easy insight into the value that marketing generates.

### Contribution by channel

A donut visualization that shows a distribution of the contribution by various channels. This visualization showcases incrementality through the lens of the top three performing channels (excluding base and *All others* categories). The visualization helps to support prioritization and budget allocation.

### Marketing performance summary {#marketing-performance-summary}


>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="models_insights_marketingperformancesummary"
>title="Undefined channels"
>abstract="Undefined channels are included, but have no attributed conversions."


A horizontal bar graph visualization that displays the ROI or CPA performance by each of the channels. This visualization highlights the ROI / CPA of your marketing investments. The channels are ranked in descending order based on ROI / CPA. The visualization helps to identify which channels are most effective and which might need optimization. 

Undefined channels are included in the visualization but have no attributed conversions.


### Marginal response curves  

The line chart visualizes and compares the marginal returns generated by the investment in your marketing channels.  And identifies the current spend point and the marginal break-even point (where your incremental return is less than your incremental spend). As a result, this visualization helps you to understand when your marketing investment starts to become less impactful.

The curve, current spend point, marginal break-even point, and corresponding values are calculated based on the selected data range and the channel you have selected. 

To change the channel:

* Select a channel from the **[!UICONTROL Channel]** dropdown menu to update the visualization for a specific channel.


### Touchpoint breakdown

The touchpoint breakdown table shows the weekly touchpoint breakdowns for all or selected channels, on a weekly base, displaying key metrics associated to each. The table allows for easy comparison, trend identification and performance tracking at a more granular channel level. This table explicitly complements the [Contribution by date and base media](#contribution-by-date-and-base-media) visualization and the [Contribution by channel](#contribution-by-channel) visualization.

![Touchpoint breakdown](../assets/touchpoint-breakdown.png)

The following columns are available:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **[!UICONTROL Date range]** | The week to report on. |
| **[!UICONTROL Touchpoint]** | The specific touchpoint channel. |
| **[!UICONTROL ROI]** | The percentage of (**[!UICONTROL Revenue]** - **[!UICONTROL Spend]**) / **[!UICONTROL Spend]**. |
| **[!UICONTROL Revenue]** | The revenue for the date range. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPA]** | **[!UICONTROL Spend]** / **[!UICONTROL Conversions]**. |
| **[!UICONTROL Conversions]** | The conversions for the date range. |
| **[!UICONTROL Spend]** | The spend for the data range. |

To select a specific channel or all channels, select from the **[!UICONTROL View]** dropdown menu.

To download the contents of the Touchpoint breakdown table, select ![Download](/help/assets/icons/Download.svg) **[!UICONTROL Download CSV]**.


## Channel synergy

In the **[!UICONTROL Channel synergy]** tab, the **[!UICONTROL Channel synergies]** visualization helps you to identify how marketing channels interact to create multiplicative effects, beyond their individual contributions.

The heatmap matrix provides a visual representation of the synergy values between pairs of spend channels. This matrix helps marketers to understand how channels interact to drive performance. For each model, synergy values are normalized from 0 to 10. These values quantify the *next dollar synergy*, which estimates how effectively two channels work together when each receives one additional dollar of spend at the current levels. 

This next-dollar framework offers a realistic measure of relative synergy strength, as the framework accounts for actual spend conditions in the training data and as such enables more informed optimization decisions.

![Plan channel synergies](/help/assets/model-channel-synergies.png)

To download a CSV file that represents the matrix, select ![Download](/help/assets/icons/Download.svg) **[!UICONTROL Download]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the **[!UICONTROL Channel synergy]** tab is not visible for an existing model, ensure you retrain the model to enable the functionality and visualization.



## **[!UICONTROL Factors]** [!BADGE beta] {#factors}

>[!CONTEXTUALHELP]
>id="models_factors_factorcontributionbreakdown"
>title="Factor contribution breakdown"
>abstract="The factor contribution breakdown shows the proportion of the base conversions that can be attributed to the various factors included in the model.<br/><br/>Pure base represents the underlying conversions that occur independently of the marketing touchpoints and factors included in the model. It includes conversions driven by brand equity, repeat purchases, organic demand, and long-term market trends and seasonality."


The Factors [!BADGE beta] tab shows external factor related insights. 

![Factors](/help/assets/factors.png)

This visualization helps you to understand the incremental effect that various internal and external factors have on the baseline of conversions. For example, economic conditions or promotional activities.

Use the **[!UICONTROL Factors]** dropdown menu to select which factors you want to display.

<!-- need to update the image when we do have a proper example -->

  You can select each of the additional column headers to sort the table in ascending or descending order.
  
To close the expanded Top campaigns dialog, select **[!UICONTROL Close]**.


### [!UICONTROL Breakdown by touchpoint position]

The [!UICONTROL Breakdown by touchpoint position] visualization is a breakdown of attributed conversions by position of the touchpoint and touchpoint across all the conversion paths. This chart helps you to compare if a touchpoint contributes better at a position than remaining positions and other touchpoints at any position. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The sum of percentage contribution for an attribution model across all touchpoints and positions should be equal to 100. 


The positions [!UICONTROL Starter], [!UICONTROL Player] and [!UICONTROL Closer] are defined as follows:

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| [!UICONTROL Starter] | This position indicates whether the touchpoint is the first touch in a conversion path. |
| [!UICONTROL Player] | This position indicates whether the touchpoint is not the first or the last touch leading to conversion. |
| [!UICONTROL Closer] | This position indicates whether the touchpoint is the last touch before conversion.|


### [!UICONTROL Top conversion paths]

The [!UICONTROL Top conversion paths] visualization shows the top 5 conversion paths based on the selected attribution models. 

For each conversion path, you see:

* the number of channels that do have an impact, 
* the total attributed paths, 
* the percentage of attributed paths for this conversion path vs. total attributed paths,
* for each channel, the attribution model contribution percentage, and
* the sum of these channel attribution model contribution percentages.

The **[!UICONTROL Diagnostics]** tab shows visualizations for:

* **[!UICONTROL Model Assessment]** visualizations that consist of:

  ![Model assessment](../assets/model-assessment.png)
  
  * A graph which you can break down on actual vs. predicted or residual conversions.
    To break down the visualization, select one of the following options from the **[!UICONTROL Breakdown]** list.

    * **[!UICONTROL Actual vs Predicted]**: This option compares real values to model predictions. Ideally, the predicted values should tightly align with the actual values, though some deviation is expected. Large or systematic deviations or patterns may indicate missing relationships and data or potential biases.

    * **[!UICONTROL Residuals]**: This option shows the difference between actual and predicted values. A well-performing model has residuals that are randomly distributed, without clear patterns or increasing spread. Structured trends or widening residuals may signal missing relationships and data or variance issues.

  * A table showing the following columns for each conversion metric:
  
    * **[!UICONTROL Actual Conversion]**
    * **[!UICONTROL Predicted Conversion]**
    * **[!UICONTROL Residual Conversion]**
    * **[!UICONTROL R<sup>2</sup>]**, a score which tells how well the data fits the regression model (the goodness of fit).
    * **[!UICONTROL MAPE]** (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), which is one of the most commonly used KPIs to measure forecast accuracy and expresses the forecast error as a percentage of the actual value.
    * **[!UICONTROL RMSE]** (Root Mean Square Error): which shows the average error, weighted according to the square of the error.
    
  To download a CSV file containing the data for the table, select ![Download](/help/assets/icons/Download.svg).

* **[!UICONTROL Model training fit metrics]** table that displays for each conversion metric:

  ![Model training fit metrics table](../assets/model-training-fit-metrics.png)

  * **[!UICONTROL Training R<sup>2</sup>]**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the actual values explained by the model's predictions, ranging from 0 to 1.
  * **[!UICONTROL Training sMAPE]** (symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Measures average percentage error on training data. Lower values indicate better accuracy.
  * **[!UICONTROL Training RMSE]** (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures average percentage error on training data. Penalizes larger errors more than MAPE. Lower RMSE suggests better predictive accuracy but is sensitive to outliers.
  * **[!UICONTROL Out-of-sample sMAPE]**: Evaluates percentage error on unseen data, balancing over- and under-predictions. Helps to assess generalization. Currently, Mix Modeler evaluates percentage error using the last quarter of training data as a holdout set.
  * **[!UICONTROL Out-of-sample RMSE]**: Evaluates percentage error on unseen data, balancing over- and under-predictions. Helps assess generalization. Currently, Mix Modeler evaluates percentage error using the last quarter of training data as a holdout set. RMSE penalizes larger errors more than MAPE.


* **[!UICONTROL Touchpoint effectiveness]** table, representing the outcome of the Attribution AI algorithmic model. 

  ![Touchpoint effectiveness table](../assets/touchpoint-effectiveness.png)
  
   The data for this table is only generated for specific periods of time. Select **[!UICONTROL As of *xx/xx/xx, xx:xx TZ*]**  ![Info](/help/assets/icons/InfoOutline.svg) for more details.  
  
  The visualization shows, in descending order of [!UICONTROL Efficiency measure] ![Descending Order](/help/assets/icons/SortOrderDown.svg), for each touchpoint:

  * **[!UICONTROL Paths touched]**: visualizes the percentage of paths achieving conversion and percentage of paths not achieving conversion. For a touchpoint, you see more attributed conversions when the attribution conversion ratio is high. This ratio compares the percentage of paths that lead to conversion versus the percentage of paths that do *not* lead to conversion.
  * **[!UICONTROL Efficiency measure]**: generated by the algorithmic attribution model, the efficiency measure indicates the relative importance of a touchpoint toward conversion, independent of touchpoint volume. The efficiency is measured on a scale of 1 to 5. Note that higher touchpoint volume does not guarantee higher efficiency measure.
  * **[!UICONTROL Total volume]**: The aggregate number of times a user touches a touchpoint. The number is inclusive of touchpoints that appear on a path achieving conversion as well as paths *not* resulting in conversion.
