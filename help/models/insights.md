## Model quality

The Model quality tab shows widgets for measuring:

* R2 (R-squared), which tells how well the data fits the regression model (the goodness of fit).

* MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), which is one of the most commonly used KPIs to measure forecast accuracy and expresses the forecast error as a percentage of the actual value.

* RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): which shows the average "error", weighted according to the square of the error.
