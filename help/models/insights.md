# Model Insights

To view model insights, in the ![Models](../assets/icons/FileData.svg) **[!UICONTROL Models]** interface in Mix Modeler:

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Models]** table, select the name of a model that has a **[!UICONTROL Last run status]** of <span style="color:green">‚óè</span> **[!UICONTROL Success]**.
   
1. From the context menu, select **[!UICONTROL Model Insights]**.

You see when the specified model is last refreshed and widgets are displayed using three tabs: Historical overview, Model insights, and Model quality.

You can change the date period on which the widgets on each of the tabs are based on. Enter a date period or select ![Calendar](../assets/icons/Calendar.svg) to select a date period.


## Historical overview

The Historical overview tab shows widgets for:

* Conversion and Spend by Fiscal Qtr and Product.
  
* Spend by Channel.

* Touchpoint Spend.

  You can select an alternative spend-based channel to display for this widget. Select a channel from **[!UICONTROL Channels]**.

* Touchpoint Volume.

    You can select an alternative volume-based channel to display for this widget. Select a channel from **[!UICONTROL Channels]**.

## Model insights

The Model insights tab shows widgets for:

* Contribution by date and base media. The stacked graph is ordered: Base at the bottom, Non-spend channels in the middle, and Spend channels on top.

* Contribution by channel.

* Marketing performance summary.

* Marginal response curves. 
  <br/>Select a channel from the **[!UICONTROL Channel]** dropdown list to update the widget for a specific channel.

You can hover over individual chart elements in each widget to display a popover with more details.

To download a CSV file containing the data for the widget, select ![Download](../assets/icons/Download.svg).

To download full model insights data in Microsoft&reg; Excel format, select ![Download](../assets/icons/Download.svg) **[!UICONTROL Download data]**. 


## Diagnostics

The Diagnostics tab shows widgets for:

* [!UICONTROL Model Assessment] visualization, which you can break down on Actual vs. Predicted or Residual conversions.

  To break down the visualization, select **[!UICONTROL Actual vs. Predicted]** or **[!UICONTROL Residuals]** from the **[!UICONTROL Breakdown]** list.

* [!UICONTROL Model fitting metrics] table, showing the following columns for each conversion metric:
  
  * Actual Conversion
    
  * Modeled Conversion
    
  * Residual Conversion (difference between actual and modeled conversion)
    
  * Model quality score values:

      * R2 (R-squared), which tells how well the data fits the regression model (the goodness of fit).

      * MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), which is one of the most commonly used KPIs to measure forecast accuracy and expresses the forecast error as a percentage of the actual value.

      * RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): which shows the average error, weighted according to the square of the error.

  To download a CSV file containing the data for the table, select ![Download](../assets/icons/Download.svg).

* [!UICONTROL Touchpoint effectiveness] table, which is generated by the Attribution AI algorithmic model. The data for this table is only generated for specific periods of time. Select **[!UICONTROL As of *xx/xx/xx, xx:xx TZ*]**  ![Info](../assets/icons/InfoOutline.svg) for more details.  
  
  The visualization shows, in descending order of [!UICONTROL Effciency measure] ![Descending Order](../assets/icons/SortOrderDown.svg), for each touchpoint:

  * [!UICONTROL Paths touched]: visualizes the percentage of paths achieving conversion and percentage of paths not achieving conversion. For a touchpoint, you see higher attributed conversions if the ratio of the percentage of paths achieving conversion to the percentage of paths *not* achieving conversion is high.
  * [!UICONTROL Efficiency measure]: generated by the algorithmic attribution model, the efficiency measure indicates the relative importance of a touchpoint toward conversion, independent of touchpoint volume. The efficiency is measured on a scale of 1 to 5. Note that higher touchpoint volume does not guarantee higher efficiency measure.
  * [!UICONTROL Total volume]: The aggregate number of times a user touches a touchpoint. The number is inclusive of touchpoints that appear on a path achieving conversion as well as paths *not* resulting in conversion.

## [!UICONTROL Attribution]

Using the [!UICONTROL Attribution] tab, you can understand the effectiveness of touchpoints and marketing campaigns that have event level data. The following attribution models are supported:

* Based on the selected model in Mix Modeler:
  * Algorithmic - Influenced
  * Algorithmic - Incremental
* Rule based:
  * Decay units
  * First touch
  * Last touch
  * Linear
  * Ushape

Select one or more attribution models from the **[!UICONTROL Attribution Model]** dropdown list. The selected attribution models apply to all widgets in the Attribution tab.

![Attribution](../assets/model-insights-attribution.png)

The Mix Modeler multi-touch attribution granular event scores will align to the overal Mix Modeler scores and ROIs. These scores are also made available as datasets in Experience Platform.

The Attribution tab consists of the following widgets:

### [!UICONTROL Overview]

The [!UICONTROL Overview] widget shows, for the selected attribution models, the conversions totals and percentages.

To see details, hover over any of the chart elements.

### [!UICONTROL Trends]

The [!UICONTROL Daily trends], [!UICONTROL Weekly trends], or [!UICONTROL Monthly trends] widget shows, for the selected attribution models, the daily, weekly, or monthly conversion trends.

To choose the period, select **[!UICONTROL Daily trends]**, **[!UICONTROL Weekly trends]** or **[!UICONTROL Monthly trends]** from ![More](../assets/icons/More.svg).

To see details, hover over any of the chart elements.

### [!UICONTROL Breakdown]

The [!UICONTROL Breakdown] widget is a breakdown by channel or touchpoint of the conversions for each of the selected attribution models. 

To choose the breakdown type, select **[!UICONTROL Breakdown by channel]** or **[!UICONTROL Breakdown by touchpoint]** from ![More](../assets/icons/More.svg).

To see details, hover over any of the chart elements.

### [!UICONTROL Top campaigns]

The Top campaigns widget shows a table of the top campaigns with columns for Campaign name, Channel, Media type and Incremental conversions.

To sort the table in ascending (![Arrow Up](../assets/icons/SortOrderUp.svg)) or descending order (![Arrow Up](../assets/icons/SortOrderDown.svg)) for Channel, Media type or Incremental conversions, select the column header and toggle the sort.

To expand the table in a separate dialog, select **[!UICONTROL Expand]** from ![More](../assets/icons/More.svg).

The expanded Top campaigns dialog shows the same table with addition coluns for 

* Incremental conversions, 
* Influenced conversions, 
* First touch conversions, and 
* Last touch conversions. 
 
  You can select each of the additional column headers to sort the table in ascending or descending order.
  
To close the expanded Top campaigns dialog, select **[!UICONTROL Close]**.


### [!UICONTROL Breakdown by touchpoint position]

The [!UICONTROL Breakdown by toucpoint position] visualization is a breakdown of attributed conversions by position of the touchpoint and touchpoint across all the conversion paths. This chart helps you to compare if a touchpoint contributes better at a position than that of remaining positions and other touchpoints at any position. 

Note that the sum of percentage contribution for an attribution model across all touchpoints and positions should be equal to 100. 

The positions [!UICONTROL Starter], [!UICONTROL Player] and [!UICONTROL Closer] are defined as follows:

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| [!UICONTROL Starter] | Indicates whether the touchpoint is the first touch in a conversion path. |
| [!UICONTROL Player] | Indicates whether the touchpoint is neither the first nor the last touch leading to conversion. |
| [!UICONTROL Closer] | Indicates whether the touchpoint is the last touch before conversion.| 


### [!UICONTROL Top conversion paths]

The [!UICONTROL Top conversion paths] visualization shows the top 5 conversion paths based on the selected attribution models. 

For each conversion path, you see:

* the number of channels that do have impact, 
* the total attributed paths, 
* the percentage of attributed paths for this conversion path vs. total attributed paths,
* for each channel, the attribution model contribution percentage, and
* the sum of these channel attribution model contribution percentages.
