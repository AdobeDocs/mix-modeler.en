# Model insights

Each visualization in model insights is designed to help you to:

* Visualize and quantify the impact of your organization's marketing activities.
* Identify which channels are high-performing.
* Identify which channels might need optimization.

These insights then help you to support resource prioritization and allocation.

To view model insights, in the ![Models](/help/assets/icons/FileData.svg) **[!UICONTROL Models]** interface in Mix Modeler:

1. From the **[!UICONTROL Models]** table, select the name of a model that has a **[!UICONTROL Last run status]** of <span style="color:green">‚óè</span> **[!UICONTROL Success]**.
   
1. From the context menu, select **[!UICONTROL Model Insights]**.

![Model insights tab bar](/help/assets/model-insights-tabbar.png)

You see when the specified model is last refreshed and visualizations are displayed using four tabs: [Model insights](#model-insights), [Attribution](#attribution), [Factors](#factors), [Diagnostics](#diagnostics), and [Historical overview](#historical-overview).

You can change the date period on which the visualizations on each of the tabs are based on. Enter a date period or select ![Calendar](/help/assets/icons/Calendar.svg) to select a date period.

## [!UICONTROL Model insights]

The Model insights tab shows visualizations for [Contribution by date and base media](#contribution-by-date-and-base-media), [Contribution by channel](#contribution-by-channel), [Marketing performance summary](#marketing-performance-summary), and [Marginal response curves](#marginal-response-curves). The tab also provides a [Touchpoint breakdown](#touchppint-breakdown) table.

![Model - Model insights](/help/assets/model-insights-insights.png)

* You can hover over individual chart elements in each visualization to display a popover with more details.

* To download a CSV file containing the data for the visualization, select ![Download](/help/assets/icons/Download.svg).

* To download full model insights data in Microsoft&reg; Excel format, select ![Download](/help/assets/icons/Download.svg) **[!UICONTROL Download data]**. 


### Contribution by date and base media. 

This stacked graph visualization is ordered as follows: 

* Base at the bottom. 
* Non-spend channels in the middle.
* Spend channels on top. 

This visualization represents the contribution proportion achieved by base, by spend channels, and by non-spend channels, across a date range. This visualization is helpful to showcase incrementality. The base represents what would have happened without any marketing at all, and the non-spend channels plus spend channels (on top of the base) attribute to your marketing's impact. In short, non-spend plus spend equals the incremental impact of your marketing efforts and the visualization provides easy insight into the value that marketing generates.

### Contribution by channel

A donut visualization that shows a distribution of the contribution by various channels. This visualization showcases incrementality through the lens of the top three performing channels (excluding base and *All others* categories). The visualization helps to support prioritization and budget allocation.

### Marketing performance summary.

A horizontal bar graph displaying the ROI performance by channel.

A horizontal bar graph visualization that displays the ROI or CPA performance by each of the channels. This visualization highlights the ROI / CPA of your marketing investments. The channels are ranked in descending order based on ROI / CPA. The visualization helps to identify which channels are most effective and which might need optimization.

### Marginal response curves.  

The line chart visualizes and compares the marginal returns generated by the investment in your marketing channels.  And identifies the break-even point where your incremental return is less than your incremental spend. As a result, this visualization helps you to understand when your marketing investment starts to become less impactful.

The curve, break-even point, and corresponding values are calculated based on the selected data range and the channel you have selected. 

To change the channel:

* Select a channel from the **[!UICONTROL Channel]** dropdown menu to update the visualization for a specific channel.


### Touchpoint breakdown

The touchpoint breakdown table shows the weekly touchpoint breakdowns for all or selected channels on a weekly base, displaying key metrics associated to each. The table allows for easy comparison, trend identification and performance tracking at a more granular channel level. This table explicitly complements the [Contribution by date and base media](#contribution-by-date-and-base-media) visualization and the [Contribution by channel](#contribution-by-channel) visualization.

![Touchpoint breakdown](../assets/touchpoint-breakdown.png)

The following columns are available:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **[!UICONTROL Date range]** | The week to report on. |
| **[!UICONTROL Touchpoint]** | The specific touchpoint channel. |
| **[!UICONTROL ROI]** | The percentage of (**[!UICONTROL Revenue]** - **[!UICONTROL Spend]**) / **[!UICONTROL Spend]**. |
| **[!UICONTROL Revenue]** | The revenue for the date range. |
| **[!UICONTROL CPA]** | **[!UICONTROL Spend]** / **[!UICONTROL Conversions]**. |
| **[!UICONTROL Conversions]** | The conversions for the date range. |
| **[!UICONTROL Spend]** | The spend for the data range. |

To select a specific channel or all channels, select from the **[!UICONTROL View]** dropdown menu.

To download the contents of the Touchpoint breakdown table, select ![Download](/help/assets/icons/Download.svg) **[!UICONTROL Download CSV]**.

## **[!UICONTROL Factors]** [!BADGE beta]

The Factors [!BADGE beta] tab shows external factor related insights. 

![Factors](/help/assets/factors.png)

This visualization helps you to understand the incremental effect that various internal and external factors have on the baseline of conversions. For example, economic conditions or promotional activities.

Use the **[!UICONTROL Factors]** dropdown menu to select which factors you want to display.

<!-- need to update the image when we do have a proper example -->

If no data is available you see a message ![TableAndChart](/help/assets/icons/TableAndChart.svg) **[!UICONTROL No data is available, you may need to retrain your model, or change the date range to view insights]**.

## [!UICONTROL Attribution]

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Attribution tab is only available for MTA enabled models.


Using the [!UICONTROL Attribution] tab, you can understand the effectiveness of touchpoints and marketing campaigns that have event level data.  See [Build model](build.md). 

The following attribution models are supported:

* Based on the selected model in Mix Modeler:
  * Algorithmic - Influenced
  * Algorithmic - Incremental
* Rule based:
  * Decay units

  * Last touch
  * Linear
  * Ushape

See [Multi-touch attribution](../get-started/about.md#multi-touch-attribution) for an introduction on the multi-touch attribution capability in Mix Modeler.

Select one or more attribution models from the **[!UICONTROL Attribution Model]** dropdown menu. The selected attribution models apply to all visualizations in the Attribution tab.

![Attribution](/help/assets/model-insights-attribution.png)

The Mix Modeler multi-touch attribution granular event scores align to the overall Mix Modeler scores and ROIs. These scores are also made available as datasets in Experience Platform.

The Attribution tab consists of the following visualizations:

### [!UICONTROL Overview]

The [!UICONTROL Overview] visualization shows, for the selected attribution models, the conversions totals and percentages. Selecting more models adds additional circles to the visualization, each with its own color corresponding to the legend.

To see a popup with details for an attribution model, hover over any of the circles in the visualization.

### [!UICONTROL Trends]

The [!UICONTROL Daily trends], [!UICONTROL Weekly trends], or [!UICONTROL Monthly trends] visualization shows, for the selected attribution models, the daily, weekly, or monthly conversion trends.

To see details, hover over the data line of a specific attribution model to display a popover that shows the total number of conversions for that data. 

### [!UICONTROL Breakdown]

The [!UICONTROL Breakdown] visualization is a breakdown by channel or touchpoint of the conversions for each of the selected attribution models. This visualization can be helpful to make decisions on the effectiveness of each channel or touchpoint.

To choose the breakdown type, select **[!UICONTROL Breakdown by channel]** or **[!UICONTROL Breakdown by touchpoint]** from ![More](/help/assets/icons/More.svg).

To see details, hover over any of the chart elements.

### [!UICONTROL Top campaigns]

The Top campaigns visualization shows a table of the top campaigns with columns for Campaign name, Channel, Media type and Incremental conversions. This visualization can help inform your team of the effectiveness of a specific campaign for a given channel and provide insights on what campaigns you should further invest into.

To sort the table in ascending &uarr; or descending order &darr; for Channel, Media type or Incremental conversions, select the column header and toggle the sort.

To expand the table in a separate dialog, select **[!UICONTROL Expand]** from ![More](/help/assets/icons/More.svg).

The expanded Top campaigns dialog shows the same table with addition columns for 

* Incremental conversions 
* Influenced conversions
* First touch conversions
* Last touch conversions
 
  You can select each of the additional column headers to sort the table in ascending or descending order.
  
To close the expanded Top campaigns dialog, select **[!UICONTROL Close]**.


### [!UICONTROL Breakdown by touchpoint position]

The [!UICONTROL Breakdown by touchpoint position] visualization is a breakdown of attributed conversions by position of the touchpoint and touchpoint across all the conversion paths. This chart helps you to compare if a touchpoint contributes better at a position than remaining positions and other touchpoints at any position. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>The sum of percentage contribution for an attribution model across all touchpoints and positions should be equal to 100. 


The positions [!UICONTROL Starter], [!UICONTROL Player] and [!UICONTROL Closer] are defined as follows:

| Position | Description |
|---|---|
| [!UICONTROL Starter] | This position indicates whether the touchpoint is the first touch in a conversion path. |
| [!UICONTROL Player] | This position indicates whether the touchpoint is not the first or the last touch leading to conversion. |
| [!UICONTROL Closer] | This position indicates whether the touchpoint is the last touch before conversion.| 


### [!UICONTROL Top conversion paths]

The [!UICONTROL Top conversion paths] visualization shows the top 5 conversion paths based on the selected attribution models. 

For each conversion path, you see:

* the number of channels that do have an impact, 
* the total attributed paths, 
* the percentage of attributed paths for this conversion path vs. total attributed paths,
* for each channel, the attribution model contribution percentage, and
* the sum of these channel attribution model contribution percentages.


## [!UICONTROL Diagnostics]

The Diagnostics tab shows visualizations for:

* [!UICONTROL Model Assessment] visualization, which you can break down on Actual vs. Predicted or Residual conversions.

  To break down the visualization, select **[!UICONTROL Actual vs. Predicted]** or **[!UICONTROL Residuals]** from the **[!UICONTROL Breakdown]** list.

* [!UICONTROL Model fitting metrics] table, showing the following columns for each conversion metric:
  
  * Actual Conversion
    
  * Modeled Conversion
    
  * Residual Conversion (difference between actual and modeled conversion)
    
  * Model quality score values:

      * R2 (R-squared), which tells how well the data fits the regression model (the goodness of fit).

      * MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), which is one of the most commonly used KPIs to measure forecast accuracy and expresses the forecast error as a percentage of the actual value.

      * RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): which shows the average error, weighted according to the square of the error.

  To download a CSV file containing the data for the table, select ![Download](/help/assets/icons/Download.svg).

* [!UICONTROL Touchpoint effectiveness] table, representing the outcome of the Attribution AI algorithmic model. The data for this table is only generated for specific periods of time. Select **[!UICONTROL As of *xx/xx/xx, xx:xx TZ*]**  ![Info](/help/assets/icons/InfoOutline.svg) for more details.  
  
  The visualization shows, in descending order of [!UICONTROL Efficiency measure] ![Descending Order](/help/assets/icons/SortOrderDown.svg), for each touchpoint:

  * [!UICONTROL Paths touched]: visualizes the percentage of paths achieving conversion and percentage of paths not achieving conversion. For a touchpoint, you see more attributed conversions when the attribution conversion ratio is high. This ratio compares the percentage of paths that lead to conversion versus the percentage of paths that do *not* lead to conversion.
  * [!UICONTROL Efficiency measure]: generated by the algorithmic attribution model, the efficiency measure indicates the relative importance of a touchpoint toward conversion, independent of touchpoint volume. The efficiency is measured on a scale of 1 to 5. Note that higher touchpoint volume does not guarantee higher efficiency measure.
  * [!UICONTROL Total volume]: The aggregate number of times a user touches a touchpoint. The number is inclusive of touchpoints that appear on a path achieving conversion as well as paths *not* resulting in conversion.
