# Scoring data

As part of scoring a model, scoring data is persisted within a dataset in Experience Platform. When you have enabled muti-touch attribution during model creation, additional event score data are persisted within a dataset in Experience Platform.

Each of these datasets conforms to a schema. This article documents these schemas.


## Aggregate scoring data schema

The schema for scoring data is named like `AMM AI Schema - <name of model> <id>`. For example: `AMM AI Schema - Model for Online Conversion 10120`.

The dataset, persisting the scoring data for a model, is named like `AMM AI Aggregrate Scores - <id>`, for example `AMM AI Aggregrate Scores - 10120`.

The schema includes a field group with an object containing details about the scores. The object consists of the following fields.

| Field Name | Type | Definition | 
|---|---|---|
| `campaignGroup` | String | Name of the campaign group. | 
| `campaignName` | String | Name of the campaign. | 
| `contribution` | Double | Contribution attributed to this conversion for the given touchpoint. |
| `conversionEndDate` | Date | End date of the conversion window. |  
| `conversionName` | String | Name of the conversion that was created during the conversion definition setup step. |  
| `conversionStartDate` | Date | Start date of the conversion window. | 
| `geo` | String | The geographic location where the conversion has occurred.  | 
| `mediaChannel` | String | Name of the channel that was used during the touchpoint setup step. |  
| `mediaSubChannel` | String | Name of the subchannel. | 
| `revenue` | Double | Revenue attributed to this conversion for the given touchpoint. |  
| `scoreCreatedTime` | DateTime | Timestamp when this score record is created. | 
| `touchpointEndDate` | Date | End date of the touchpoint window. | 
| `touchpointName` | String | Name of the touchpoint that was created during the touchpoint definition setup step. Currently the touchpoint is defined on the media channel. | 
| `touchpointStartDate` | Date | Start date of the touchpoint window. |


## Event scoring data schema

The schema for scoring data is named like `Attribution AI Scores - <name of model> <id> - Schema`. For example: `Attribution AI Scores - Model for Online Conversion 10120 - Schema`.

The dataset, persisting the scoring data for a model, is named like `Attribution AI Scores - <name of model> <id>`, for example `Attribution AI Scores - Model for Online Conversion 10120 `.

The schema includes a field group containing an object containing details about the cores. The object is named like `attibution_AI_scores__<name of model> id`.

The field group contains the following fields.

| Field Name | Type | Description |
