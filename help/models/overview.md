# Models

The model functionality in Adobe Mix Modeler allows you to configure, train and score AI/ML models specific to your business objectives and supported by AI-driven transfer learning between multitouch attribution and marketing mix modeling. 

The models are based on the harmonized data view you create as part of the Adobe Mix Modeler application workflow.

To create a new model, use the Mix Modeler workflow. Select Guide me. See [Create a model](create.md) for more details.
