# Adobe Mix Modeler use cases

Adobe Mix Modeler enables the following key use cases.

## Understand omnichannel incremental performance

This use case helps you to measure the impact of marketing across all paid, earned, and owned channels.

+++ Details

### Challenges

The challenges this use case addresses are:

* Difficult to measure incremental performance from siloed customer journey data, signal loss, and walled gardens.
* Inconsistency in insights from separated MMM and MTA methodologies, reducing confidence in results.
* Limited understanding of what marketing channels and tactics drive success.

### Approach

The step based approach for this use case:

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| Ingest | Identify and ingest data sources under common schemas. <br/>Leverage existing investments in  Adobe Analytics or Customer Journey Analytics to fast-track deployment. |
| Configure | Configure flexible models using AI-as-a-Service framework for your specific business objectives<br/>Automatically ensure consistency between touchpoint & summary-level with bidirectional transfer learning. |
| Analyze | Clearly understand ROI of overall marketing and individual channels / subchannels.<br/>Clearly understand which touchpoints best drive incremental conversions. |

## Make data-driven inflight optimizations

This use case helps you to improve ROI weekly by assessing actual and forecasted performance to make inflight improvements.

+++ Details

### Challenges

The challenges this use case addresses are:

* Campaign performance is often slow, or lacks granularity need to confidently optimize.
* Messy, non-standardized data across dozens of channels and sources drives slow time to insight.
* No democratized access to tools and overreliance on select experts or external vendors, increasing turnaround times.



### Approach

The step based approach for this use case:

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| Ingest | Ingest data in common schemas for easy model refreshes and reusability across Experience Platform applications.<br/>Streamline data piping, cleaning & QA with automated harmonization tools. |
| Refresh | Build and refresh AI/ML  models using a user-friendly, self-service platform.<br/>Get new results, including historic and forecasted ROIs by channel, on a weekly or monthly basis. |
| Optimize | Make rapid inflight optimizations by shifting spend across channels based on measured performance. |

{style="table-layout:auto"}


### Impact 

Successful implementation of this use can have the following impact:

* Maximize speed, scalability, and usability across measurement & analytic use cases with standardized data schemas and common data foundation.
* Rapidly make weekly or monthly inflight optimizations and maximize ROI with data-driven spend shifts that reflect best forecasted ROIs.

+++

## Activate tactical insights across Adobe applications

This use case helps you to gain strategic incremental insights on customer segments and journeys by accessing touchpoint scores.

+++ Details

### Challenges

The challenges this use case addresses are:

* Top-down solutions alone may miss on identifying granular key optimization opportunities.
* Outputs of measurement models are overwhelming, overly descriptive, and do not easily lead to insights or actions.
* Cannot conduct ad-hoc analyses to gain insights because models are not transparent and granular scores are not available.


### Approach

The step based approach for this use case:

| Step | Details |
|---|---|
| Model | Configure and train AI/ML model to obtain consistent MTA touchpoint scores and MMM aggregate results. |
| Analyze | Export incremental touchpoint scores into Customer Journey Analytics or external BI tools.<br/>Perform granular analysis and build advanced dashboards using touchpoint scores. |
| Action | Create and activate lookalikes to top consumer segments using Real-Time Customer Data Platform.<br/>Develop data-driven marketing strategies by customer segments for future campaigns. | 

{style="table-layout:auto"}


### Impact 

Successful implementation of this use can have the following impact:

* Develop an understanding of incremental customer behavior and marketing tactics to inform strategic priorities for marketing and across the organisation.
