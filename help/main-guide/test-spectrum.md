# Test Spectrum

Here is a test of using Spectrum icons:

| Option | Result |
|---|---|
|User icon with `![User](/help/assets/icons/User.svg)` |![User](/help/assets/icons/User.svg)|
| User icon with `![User](/help/assets/icons/User.svg){width=150}` | ![User](/help/assets/icons/User.svg){width=150} |
| User icons with `<img src="../assets/icons/User.svg" width=150/>` | <img src="../assets/icons/User.svg" width=150/> |

Downside of using `<img...>` is that is only seems to accept relative paths, which is difficult with articles on different levels....
