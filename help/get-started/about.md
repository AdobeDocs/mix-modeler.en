# Mix Modeler overview

Mix Modeler, powered by Adobe Sensei, enables marketers to measure campaigns and optimize planning holistically across all channels: paid, earned, and owned. Its unified methodology measures incrementally at both marketing touchpoints and aggregate-levels, while ensuring fully consistent results.

Mix Modeler provides the incremental impact of all marketing activities on business and campaign outcomes through a holistic (end-to-end) measurement application for digital and offline marketing. 

Mix Modeler provides the following types of optimized and actionable insights at a strategic and tactical level, so you can better understand:

* marketing spend and resulting performance across various channels, and
* recommended investment levels to achieve future business objectives.


To accomplish this functionality, Mix Modeler combines: 

* bottoms-up (event-level) data and top-down (aggregate-level) data,
* external market factors and internal factors, and
* predictive and transfer machine-learning methodologies.

The AI/ML bidirectional transfer learning unifies marketing mix modeling (MMM) and multi-touch attribution (MTA) results to ensure consistent results across measurement and planning in a cookie-less world.
