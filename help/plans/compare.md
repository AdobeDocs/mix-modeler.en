# Compare plans

To compare plans in the Mix Modeler Plans interface: 

* Select ![Compare](/help/assets/icons/Compare.svg) **[!UICONTROL Compare Plans]**. In Compare plans, select a plan for each **[!UICONTROL _Select plan_]**.

* Alternatively, you can select two plans from the Plans table, and from the action bar select ![Compare](/help/assets/icons/Compare.svg) **[!UICONTROL Compare]**.

The Compare plans interface shows information and visualizations on:

* **[!UICONTROL Plan]**. If the plan is a target based plan (for example, ROI or CPA), you see a badge that displays the status of the target (for example, Target achievable).
* **[!UICONTROL Date range]**
* **[!UICONTROL Model]**
* **[!UICONTROL Total budget]**
* **[!UICONTROL Channel budgeting]**: **[!UICONTROL AI automated]** or **[!UICONTROL Custom + AI]**
* **[!UICONTROL Planned spend]**
* **[!UICONTROL Forecasted ROI]** or **[!UICONTROL CPA]**
  * Forecasted ROI is the overall forecasted ROI of the plan (inclusive of incremental revenue from base and non-spend channels).
  * Forecasted CPA is the overall forecasted CPA of the plan (inclusive of incremental revenue from base and non-spend channels).
* **[!UICONTROL Paid marketing ROI]**  or **[!UICONTROL CPA]**
  * Paid marketing ROI is a subset of forecasted ROI. Paid marketing ROI is the ROI for only the paid channels in the plan.
  * Paid marketing CPA is a subset of forecasted CPA. Paid marketing CPA is the CPA for only the paid channels in the plan.
