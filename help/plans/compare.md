# Compare plans

To compare plans in the Mix Modeler Plans interface: 

* Select ![Compare](/help/assets/icons/Compare.svg) **[!UICONTROL Compare Plans]**. In Compare plans, select a plan for each **[!UICONTROL _Select plan_]**.

* Alternatively, you can select two plans from the Plans table, and from the action bar select ![Compare](/help/assets/icons/Compare.svg) **[!UICONTROL Compare]**.

The Compare plans interface shows information and visualizations on:

* **[!UICONTROL Plan]**. If the plan is a target based plan, you see a badge that displays the status of the target.
* **[!UICONTROL Date range]**
* **[!UICONTROL Model]**
* **[!UICONTROL Total budget]**
* **[!UICONTROL Channel budgeting]**: **[!UICONTROL AI automated]** or **[!UICONTROL Custom + AI]**

* **[!UICONTROL Forecasted ROI]** (return on investment) or **[!UICONTROL CPA]** (cost per action)

* **[!UICONTROL ROI]** (return on investment) or **[!UICONTROL CPA]** (cost per action) **[!UICONTROL breakdown]**
