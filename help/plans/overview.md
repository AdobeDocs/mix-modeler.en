# Plans overview

A plan outlines the discreionary investments (for example budgets) a business intends to spend on marketing-related projects over the course of a given timeframe in service of common KPI (for example orders, revenue). Plans can incluse expenses from channels such as paid advertising, sponsored web content, events.

A plan can optionally include:

- a configured recognition window,
- multiple flight dates with each having a target budget,
- minimum and maximum budget constraints by channel and flight date.
