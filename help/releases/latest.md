## Release strategy

[!UICONTROL Mix Modeler] uses feature flags (also known as "toggles") to control the visibility of new features, allowing for controlled scale testing prior to full release. This release strategy includes the following phases:

* **Limited Testing**: A phased release begins with testing by internal Adobe users. It is then made available to a small group of customer accounts to ensure that the feature meets customer needs and expectations. 

* **Start of Rollout**: Rollout of a phased release begins with the Limited Testing phase. The release is then scaled from 0% to 100% availability to customers over the course of a couple months. Phased rollout happens at the Experience Cloud Organization level, so all entitled users in an organization receive the same experience.
