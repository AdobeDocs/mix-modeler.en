# Policies

Data usage policies are rules that describe the kinds of marketing actions that you are allowed to, or restricted from, performing on data within Experience Platform.

There are two types of policies available:

* **Data governance policy**: Restrict data activation based on the marketing action being performed and the data usage labels carried by the data in question.
* **Consent policy**: Filter the profiles that can be activated to destinations based on your customers' consent or preferences

Through **Policies**, underneath **PRIVACY** in the Adobe Mix Modeler interface, you can manage the implementation of data usage policies. See [Manage data usage policies in the UI](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/data-governance/policies/user-guide.html?lang=en) for more information.
