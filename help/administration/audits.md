# Audits

In order to increase the transparency and visibility of activities performed in the system, Adobe Mix Modeler uses the Adobe Experience Platform functionality that allows you to audit user activity for various services and capabilities in the form of "audit logs". These logs form an audit trail that can help with troubleshooting issues in Adobe Mix Modeler and on Platform, and help your business effectively comply with corporate data stewardship policies and regulatory requirements.

In a basic sense, an audit log tells who performed what action, and when. Each action recorded in a log contains metadata that indicates the action type, date and time, the email ID of the user who performed the action, and additional attributes relevant to the action type.

To access audit logs, select **[!UICONTROL Audits]** underneath **[!UICONTROL PRIVACY]** in the Adobe Mix Modeler UI. See [Managing audit logs in the UI](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/landing/governance-privacy-security/audit-logs/overview.html?lang=en#managing-audit-logs-in-the-ui) for more information.
