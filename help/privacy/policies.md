# Policies

The Policies selection in the left rail provides access to the Policies interface of Experience Platform, allowing to manage your policies, labels and marketing actions.

Currently,  Mix Modeler does not support all of the data governance functionality offered by Experience Platform. Field level access control is supported. See [Field level access control](../harmonize-data/dataset-rules.md#field-level-access-control),
